/**
 *  InBuffer.h
 *
 *  The InBuffer class is a wrapper around a data buffer and that adds
 *  some safety checks so that the rest of the library can safely read
 *  from it.
 *
 *  This is a class that is used internally by the AMQP library. As a user
 *  of this library, you normally do not have to instantiate it. However,
 *  if you do want to store or safe messages yourself, it sometimes can
 *  be useful to implement it.
