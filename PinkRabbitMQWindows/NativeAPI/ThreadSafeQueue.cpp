// A simple thread-safe queue implementation based on std::list<>::splice
// after a tip in a talk by Sean Parent of Adobe.
//
// Uses standard library threading and synchronization primitives together
// with a std::list<> container for implementing a thread-safe queue.  The
// only special thing is that the queue uses std::list<>::splice in the
// locked region to minimize locked time.
//
// Also implements a maximal size and can thus be used as a buffer between
// the elements in a pipeline with limited buffer bloat.
